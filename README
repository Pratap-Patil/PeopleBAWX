PeopleBAWX was my project with Xialin Zhang, Wee Li Yen and Bernard Shum for CS3216 Module. I am uploading its code so that it can be used if somebody finds it helpful.

The idea is - its a fully functional scheduler program for a TV Channel to schedule shows, extract them in a format in a DVD or some device and then transfer the device to the village and run the show in a village using the Broadcaster component.

email me for more details and permission to use it.
